As used in this Agreement, 'we', 'us', or 'our' means Offer Shopper Internet Private Limited or any of our affiliate; parent; or group companies and our successors and assigns, as the case may be, and 'you' means the applicant. Offer Shopper Site means, collectively, the Offer Shopper.com website, the Offer Shopper mobile website and the Offer Shopper mobile applications. 'Your site' means your website where you will link to the Offer Shopper Site (and which you will identify in your Program application). Save for our obligation to pay referral fees under Section 4, which may be performed solely by us, we may cause any of our obligations under this Agreement to be fulfilled by any of our Affiliates (defined below), on our behalf.",

For example, you have to be 18 years or above to enroll in this Program. To begin the enrollment process, you will submit a complete Program Application via the Offer Shopper Site. We will evaluate your application in good faith and will notify you of its acceptance or rejection.",

This includes orders for customers or on behalf of customers or orders for products to be used by you or your friends, relatives, or associates in any manner. The reason behind this policy is that the Offer Shopper Affiliate Program is an advertising program rather than a discount program. Our goal is to have our affiliates refer new customers to us in return for referral fees. Affiliates are not eligible for referral fees when they place orders themselves, or ask people they know to routinely place orders through their affiliate links so they can earn referral fees. If you are found in violation of these policies, then Offer Shopper has the right to terminate your registration, as well as revoke all payments linked to your account, unless you can show that the purchases were genuine.",

                      "B3": "For Paid Search Ads through Google AdWords campaigns or of other search engines, Affiliates cannot send users directly to the OfferShopper Site through keyword bidding or other paid search activities. However, if your Paid Search Ads, without using any OfferShopper trademarks or variations and misspelling of such trademarks, send users to your own website and then your website displays affiliate links to OfferShopper Site, you may earn referral fees for eligible purchases made by users who click through your Paid Search Ads to your website and then click through to the OfferShopper Site. You shall not include OfferShopper domain name (www.OfferShopper.com) as Display URL or Destination / Landing Page URL in the ad copies of your AdWords campaigns. Any affiliate found / identified by us (we have systems in place to identify) directing users / traffic to OfferShopper Site directly through Paid Search Ads will be penalised. Non-compliance would not only lead to suspension of your affiliate account, but also cancellation of all pending commissions and commissions thereafter."

A 'Product' is any product listed on the OfferShopper Site that is fulfilled by us or on our behalf, a Digital Product (defined below), or any product sold by a third party seller on the OfferShopper Site. For each selected Product, you will display on your site a short description, review, or other reference. You will be responsible for the content, style, and placement of these references.

You must ensure that each of the links between your site and the OfferShopper Site properly utilizes such special link formats. Links to the OfferShopper Site placed on your site pursuant to this Agreement and which properly utilize such special link formats are referred to as 'Special Links.' You will earn referral fees only with respect to activity on the OfferShopper Site occurring directly through Special Links; we will not be liable to you with respect to any failure by you to use Special Links, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts that would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement. You acknowledge that, by participating in the Affiliate Program and placing any of the above links within your site, we may receive information from or about visitors to your site or communications between your site and those visitors."
